# simple-script-store

This image serves as a support service for mu-cli.  The best introduction to simple-script-store is to [get started with mu-cli](http://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cli/#getting-started).

The simple-script-store image serves as a minimal container which makes it easy to share scripts with mu-cli.  Some functionality is offered to help write versioned scripts.

## Getting started
_Getting started with simple-script-store_

### Embedded in your project

Your project might have common project-specific scripts.  Copying a backup over to an external system or switching the default docker-compose file.  Scripts can be embedded in a project.  You can use this image with minimal overhead to write scripts embedded in your mu-project.

#### Add the service to your mu-project

The service needs to be added to your docker-compose.yml file.

The sensible default name for a service containing project-specific scripts is `project-scripts`, the sensible default folder in which to place the project-specific scripts is `scripts/project`.

As such, the docker-compose.yml service description becomes:

    project-scripts:
      image: semtech/simple-script-store:1.0.0
      volumes:
        - ./scripts/project:/app/scripts/
      restart: "no"

You can now add your `config.json` and your scripts into this folder.  More info at https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cli


### Versioned scripts for your project

Some scripts can be reused across projects, but don't belong to a single service.  You could have a backup restore facility which ties in to your local infrastructure.  The backup restore script may work for multiple projects, but only within your organization.  In such case it can make sense to provide these scripts as a versioned container.

In order to create the new image we create a folder named `zerocomp` and add a `Dockerfile` to that.  The contents of this file should look like:

    FROM semtech/simple-script-store:1.0.0

Once we have this in place, we can start adding scripts.  The `config.json` lives in the root of the service/image.  We expect to have one script in there for this example. This script should be named `run.sh` and be placed in to the `zero-backup` folder inside the service folder (`zerocomp`).

With one script, our `config.json` could look like:

    {
      "version": "0.1",
      "scripts": [
        {
          "documentation": {
            "command": "restore-zero-backup",
            "description": "Backup from Zero Up Icy Backup",
            "arguments": []
          },
          "environment": {
            "image": "ubuntu",
            "interactive": false,
            "script": "zero-backup/run.sh"
          },
          "mounts": {
            "app": "/data/app/"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

Next up, we can add the script in `./zero-backup/run.sh`.

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "I have no clue what ZeroBackup would be, but I can't really restore."

You can now make an automated or local build and add it to your project.

    cd zerocomp
    docker build . -t zerocomp/backup-scripts

And add it as a service:

    backup-scripts:
      image: zerocomp/backup-scripts
      restart: "no"

Now we can trigger the script:

    mu script backup-scripts restore-zero-backup

You're done.  Versioned scripts in your projects.

### How to add a simple echo-text script to the project

#### Adding the configuration for the script to the project

The configuration for project scripts can be found in the ./scripts/project/config.json file. This configuration file describes scripts that are located in the ./scripts/project folder. In order to add a script description open this config.json file. You will see a hash. The scripts entry is an array. You can add a hash here with the script information. A blueprint for this hash is:
```
        {
          "documentation": {
            "command": // The command that will trigger the script
            "description": // A concise description of the script
            "arguments": // An array describing the arguments
          },
          "environment": {
            "image": // the image in which the script will be executed
            "interactive": // set this to true if the script needs user interaction
            "script": // the name of the script
          },
          "mounts": {
            "app": // the location of the app
          }
        }
```

For our echo-text script we add the following block:

```
        {
          "documentation": {
            "command": "echo",
            "description": "A script that echo's some text",
            "arguments": []
          },
          "environment": {
            "image": "ubuntu",
            "interactive": false,
            "script": "echo-script/echo-text.sh"
          },
          "mounts": {
            "app": "/data/app/"
          }
        }
```

#### Adding the actual script to the project
The echo-text script could look like this; echo-name.sh:
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "hello world"
```
Create a folder named echo-script in the ./scripts/project folder.

Save this text in a file name echo-name.sh in the ./scripts/project/echo-script folder. Then change the permissions for that file with
```
chmod +x ./scripts/project/echo-script/echo-script.sh
```

#### Testing the script
```
mu script project-scripts echo
```

And you should see the following output
```
hello world
```


## Reasoning

_Background information about the approach we took_

### Timeout before exit

The container sleeps for 60 seconds before exiting.  Reasoning for this is that you might accidentally set a `restart: always` on all of your containers when running in production.  This is a good practice, but it would make this container spin up continuously.  60 seconds seems to provide a good balance between discovery and minimum system overhead.

### Minimal container

One could argue that this container should offer a bunch of support for writing scripts.  We chose not to do this because the specific needs for various scripts would be different.  We still want the image name to reflect what this container is for, and that is hosting scripts.  Other images can be constructed which will write the scripts to the right location.

## API

_Provided application interface_

### Extending this image

When extending the image, the `ONBUILD` command will at least copy:

- the `/config.json` and place it in `/app/scripts/config.json`.
- folders containing scripts, and place the folders in `/app/scripts/`.

Other files and folders may, but are not guaranteed, to be copied over.  As such, this behavior may change without a major version bump.
